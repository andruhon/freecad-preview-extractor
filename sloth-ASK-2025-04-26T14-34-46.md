Looking at this script, I can explain why the `mkdirp` module is imported but appears unused:

## Why `mkdirp` is in the code ✅

The `mkdirp` module is imported but never actually used in the code. This is a bug or oversight in the script.

`mkdirp` is a utility that creates directories recursively (like `mkdir -p` in Unix systems). It would typically be used in a scenario where:
1. You need to extract files to a directory that might not exist yet
2. You want to ensure the target directory structure exists before writing files

## Where it should have been used ⚠️

In the `extractPngFromZip` function, the code creates a write stream:

```javascript
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(outputPath);
```

If the directory for `outputPath` doesn't already exist, this will fail with an ENOENT error. The proper approach would be to ensure the directory exists before creating the write stream, like:

```javascript
// Ensure directory exists before writing file
await mkdirp(path.dirname(outputPath));
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(outputPath);
```

## Fix options ✅

1. Either use the imported `mkdirp` to ensure output directories exist
2. Remove the unused import if all output directories are guaranteed to exist already

## Additional note ⚠️

The code also includes a `checkDependencies()` function that tries to install `mkdirp` if it's not found, which suggests it was intended to be used somewhere in the script but the implementation is missing.
